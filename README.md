# LocalSOCKS5Proxy
LocalSOCKS5Proxy is a minimal, Python-based SOCKS5 proxy server designed for use cases where you need to route traffic through a remote machine or resource. It can be used in conjunction with tools such as VPNs, cloud tunnels, or similar services to allow access to remote networks or internal resources without needing admin rights.
## Key Features:
- **SOCKS5 Protocol**: Implements a basic SOCKS5 proxy for routing traffic.
- **Local Deployment**: Can be run locally to forward traffic to remote resources.
- **Lightweight**: Only requires Python and a few core libraries to run.
- **Flexible**: Compatible with services like Tailscale, ngrok, or FRP to provide enhanced remote access.

## How it Works:
- The proxy listens for SOCKS5 connections locally.
- Traffic can be routed through a remote machine or VPN tunnel.
- Configure your SOCKS5 proxy settings to point to the tool you're using for remote access (such as ngrok or FRP).
- LocalSOCKS5Proxy forwards the traffic to the remote server seamlessly.

## Use Cases:
- Accessing remote networks or machines.
- Forwarding traffic through a remote machine to access its internal resources.
- Running in environments where admin permissions are not available.
- Routing traffic when direct port access is restricted.

## Installation:
Clone the repository and run the proxy using Python:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/marksowell/LocalSOCKS5Proxy.git
cd LocalSOCKS5Proxy
python LocalSOCKS5Proxy.py
```
